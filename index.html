            <h1 id="greetings">Hi!👋</h1>
            <p>
            I'm <strong>Jade</strong> from South Korea, currently studying abroad with a focus on <strong>Media Arts.</strong> 
            As an <em>ESTP 😎</em>and <em>a Libra ⚖️</em>, I’m all about embracing adventure, balancing different aspects of life, and staying curious about the world around me. <br> <br>
            <strong>My passion is to bring hope and positivity to the world.</strong>
            I want to listen to diverse stories and create content that can inspire and energize people's everyday lives. Whether it’s through web design, animation, or another form of media, my goal is to create work that makes people feel a little more comforted and understood. 
            I believe that art has the unique power to touch hearts, spark joy, and foster connection, and that’s the kind of impact I hope to have through my work.
            
            <br><br>
            Recently, I’ve been particularly interested in <em><strong>animation</strong> and <strong>comics.</strong></em> 
            What fascinates me is how these art forms can cross boundaries, reaching people of all ages and backgrounds. 
            The storytelling in comics and animation is powerful, delivering both deep emotional experiences and pure fun in ways that resonate globally. 
            I’m inspired by the way these mediums can offer both lighthearted entertainment and meaningful messages, and I hope to contribute to this vibrant space in the future.
            </p>
